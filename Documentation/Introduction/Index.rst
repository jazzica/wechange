As WECHANGE's API offers more possibilities this extension will grow as well. As of now it offers the possibility to

* show a list of projects, optionally filtered by group and tag
* show a list of events, all or only upcoming
* show a list of conferences
* show a list of notes, optionally filtered by group
* show WECHANGE statistics
* embed the WECHANGE map via iFrame, customizable with people, events, projects, groups and ideas
